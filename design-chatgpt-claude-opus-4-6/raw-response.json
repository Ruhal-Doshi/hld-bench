  "title": "ChatGPT-like Conversational AI Web Application - High-Level Design",
  "overview": "This system is a large-scale conversational AI platform serving 20 million daily active users generating 500 million messages per day. The architecture follows a microservices pattern with clear separation between the real-time streaming layer, conversation management, LLM orchestration, and supporting services. The core design centers on a WebSocket-based streaming gateway that delivers token-by-token responses with sub-500ms time-to-first-token, backed by an LLM orchestration layer that abstracts multiple model backends (OpenAI, Anthropic, self-hosted) with automatic failover. Conversations are persisted in a sharded PostgreSQL cluster for immediate consistency, with Redis caching for hot conversation context, and S3 for file/multimodal uploads.\n\nThe system is designed for multi-region deployment with regional WebSocket gateways, global CDN for static assets, and a robust rate-limiting and billing pipeline that tracks per-request token costs. Key architectural decisions include using Server-Sent Events (SSE) over WebSocket for streaming simplicity, CQRS for separating write-heavy message ingestion from read-heavy history/search workloads, and an event-driven architecture via Kafka for decoupling billing, analytics, and audit concerns from the critical path. The admin dashboard is powered by a dedicated analytics pipeline built on ClickHouse for real-time usage monitoring and cost attribution.",

  "scalabilityStrategy": "The system employs a multi-layered horizontal scaling strategy designed to handle 20M DAU and 500M messages/day with significant headroom:\n\n**Compute Scaling (Kubernetes):** All core services run on Kubernetes (EKS) with Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics (active connections for Streaming Gateway, queue depth for File Processing). The Streaming Gateway scales based on active WebSocket connections with a target of 40K connections per pod (Go's goroutine efficiency allows this). The LLM Orchestrator scales based on in-flight requests to LLM backends.\n\n**Database Scaling (Citus Sharded PostgreSQL):** Conversations and messages are sharded by user_id using Citus, distributing data across 32+ worker nodes. This ensures all data for a single user is co-located (avoiding cross-shard queries) while distributing the 500M daily message writes evenly. Read replicas per shard handle read-heavy workloads (conversation history browsing). Connection pooling via PgBouncer (256 connections per pool) prevents connection exhaustion.\n\n**Caching Strategy:** Redis Cluster with 12+ nodes provides the caching layer. Active conversation contexts (last 10 messages) are cached with 1-hour TTL, eliminating ~80% of database reads for the hot path (LLM context assembly). Cache-aside pattern with write-through for conversation metadata ensures consistency.\n\n**Event Processing Scaling:** Kafka topics are partitioned by user_id (128 partitions per topic), allowing consumer groups to scale horizontally. Billing consumers run 32 instances processing events in parallel. Search indexer runs 16 instances with bulk indexing to Elasticsearch.\n\n**Multi-Region Deployment:** The system deploys in US-East, US-West, and EU-West regions. Each region has its own Streaming Gateway fleet, Kong Gateway, and Redis cache. PostgreSQL uses Citus with the primary write cluster in one region and fast read replicas in others. For users requiring data residency (EU), a fully independent EU cluster is maintained. Global traffic routing via Route53 latency-based routing directs users to the nearest region.\n\n**LLM Backend Scaling:** The LLM Orchestrator implements a weighted round-robin across multiple API keys per provider, connection pooling to self-hosted vLLM instances (which auto-scale GPU nodes based on queue depth), and circuit breakers per backend. Self-hosted vLLM runs on p4d.24xlarge instances with auto-scaling groups targeting 70% GPU utilization.\n\n**CDN and Static Scaling:** CloudFront serves all static assets and SSR pages from 400+ edge locations. Shared conversation pages are cached at the edge with 5-minute TTL and cache invalidation on update.\n\n**Graceful Degradation:** Under extreme load, the system implements progressive degradation: (1) reduce max context window length, (2) disable search indexing temporarily, (3) queue non-streaming requests, (4) serve cached responses for identical recent queries, (5) display wait queue UI rather than errors.",
