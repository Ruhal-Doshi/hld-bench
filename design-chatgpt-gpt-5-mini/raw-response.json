  "title": "High-Level Design: ChatGPT-like Multi-turn Conversational Platform",
  "overview": "A globally distributed, real-time web platform that enables multi-turn conversations with configurable LLM backends, streaming responses token-by-token, durable conversation history, multimodal inputs, per-user quotas and billing, and admin monitoring. The design uses managed cloud components where appropriate (AWS examples used for concreteness) and is built for 20M DAU and ~500M messages/day — with multi-region deployment, autoscaling WebSocket clusters, strong consistency for conversation data, semantic search, and resilient LLM backend routing with automatic failover and cost accounting.",

Horizontal scaling: stateless frontends and LLM Router scale via Kubernetes HPA/KEDA based on CPU/RPS/queue length. WebSocket workers scale horizontally; use managed API Gateway or ALB to handle connection scaling. Redis is scaled as a clustered ElastiCache with sharding; Aurora can be scaled by sharding conversations by tenant or hashing conversationId to different writer clusters for write throughput. Use Kafka (MSK) partitions scaled by throughput and consumer groups for parallel processing. Use autoscaling GPU pools for internal model serving (using Karpenter/Cluster Autoscaler) and spot instances to reduce cost for non-critical capacity. Employ edge caching (CloudFront) for static assets and read-heavy metadata. For search and embeddings, scale vector DB clusters independently.
