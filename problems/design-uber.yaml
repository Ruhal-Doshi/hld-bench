title: "Design Uber"
description: |
  Design a ride-sharing platform like Uber that allows riders to request rides
  and get matched with nearby drivers in real-time.

  The platform should support:
  - User registration and authentication (riders & drivers)
  - Real-time driver/rider matching based on proximity
  - Live GPS location tracking during rides
  - Surge pricing during high-demand periods
  - Payment processing (credit cards, wallets)
  - Ride history and receipts
  - Driver ratings and reviews
  - Push notifications for ride updates

  Scale target: 50 million monthly active users, 10 million rides per day,
  operating across 60+ countries.
constraints:
  - Must handle geographic distribution across 60+ countries
  - P99 latency for matching must be under 2 seconds
  - System must handle 10x traffic spikes during events
  - Payment processing must be PCI-DSS compliant
  - Real-time location updates at least every 3 seconds
