title: "Design a ChatGPT-like Web Application"
description: |
  Design a web application similar to ChatGPT that allows users to have
  multi-turn conversations with large language models.

  The platform should support:
  - User authentication and session management
  - Multi-turn conversation threads with context retention
  - Real-time streaming of LLM responses (token by token)
  - Conversation history with search and organization
  - Multiple model selection (different LLM backends)
  - Rate limiting and usage quotas per user/tier
  - Markdown rendering in responses (code blocks, tables, etc.)
  - File upload and multimodal input (images, documents)
  - Sharing conversations via public links
  - Admin dashboard for monitoring usage and costs

  Scale target: 20 million daily active users, 500 million messages per day,
  average conversation length of 10 turns.
constraints:
  - Streaming responses must start within 500ms (time to first token)
  - Must support at least 100K concurrent WebSocket connections per region
  - Conversation history must be durable and immediately consistent
  - Must handle LLM backend failures gracefully with automatic failover
  - Cost tracking per request for billing accuracy
