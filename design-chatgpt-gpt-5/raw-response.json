  "title": "ChatGPT-like Multimodal Conversational Platform (Global, Real-time, Multi-LLM)",
  "overview": "A globally distributed, real-time conversational AI platform supporting multi-turn chat with multiple LLM backends, multimodal inputs, and rich history management. The system is built for 20M DAUs and 500M messages/day with sub-500ms time-to-first-token via a high-performance WebSocket gateway, an LLM routing layer with fast failover, and region-affine, strongly consistent storage for conversation history. Analytics, cost tracking, and admin observability are first-class through an events pipeline into ClickHouse and Prometheus/Grafana. The core data plane is stateless, horizontally scalable on Kubernetes, and tolerant of provider or regional failures.",

  "scalabilityStrategy": "- Traffic and sessions: Anycast via Cloudflare to nearest region. Sticky session not required; WebSocket connections are long-lived and evenly distributed via ALB. Gateway pods autoscale on CPU and open FDs; each Go pod targets ~4–5K concurrent WS; 30 pods suffice for 150K WS with headroom per region.\n- Storage: Citus shards by user_id across nodes; co-locate primary and replicas in same AZ to minimize latency. Connection pooling with PgBouncer. Hot partitions handled by rebalancing shards. PITR and logical replication to DR region.\n- Search: OpenSearch domain scales horizontally across data nodes. Index with 1–3 primary shards per index and ILM for rollover. Async indexers consume from Kafka for sustained throughput.\n- LLM routing: Health probes and circuit breakers per provider/region; latency-aware load balancing and hedged requests before first token. In-house vLLM autoscaling on GPU metrics (queue depth, tokens/sec). Keep-alive HTTP/2 pools to reduce TTFB.\n- Rate limiting: Redis Cluster with hash tags for per-user keys ensures single-shard updates. Use sliding window with Lua for atomicity. Quotas aggregated periodically from ClickHouse and persisted to Postgres for authority.\n- WebSockets: Separate HPA based on concurrent connections and network IO. Use SO_REUSEPORT and pod anti-affinity. Idle pings to detect dead peers. Backpressure controls to avoid OOM.\n- Multi-region: Active-active per region; users are region-affined based on home region stored in profile. Cross-region failover via Cloudflare LB health checks; if home region is down, read last durable snapshot from DR and write to degraded mode (queue for backfill) with user-notice.\n- Observability: OpenTelemetry traces propagate across gateway, LLM router, connectors. SLO-based autoscaling and alerting for TTFT and error budgets.",
